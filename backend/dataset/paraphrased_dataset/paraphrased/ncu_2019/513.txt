Latent factor models (LFM), particularly matrix factorization (MF), have seen widespread use in recommender systems.  Various MF-based approaches leverage user-item rating patterns inferred from decomposed matrices, with high user-item correspondence facilitating recommendations.  Koren et al. decompose the rating matrix into low-dimensional user and item matrices, reconstructing ratings via their inner product.  Meng et al. use a hierarchical sparse Bayesian matrix factorization (HSBMF) model for salary benchmarking, predicting missing wage data.  Thai-Nghe et al. propose tensor factorization with temporal effects for efficient implicit recommendations. Abdi et al. leverage MF for large-scale dataset processing, integrating contextual data to improve recommendation quality. Park et al. combine MF with a random walk with restart (RWR) technique incorporating global bias and address the cold-start problem.  Kawale et al. apply particle Thompson sampling (PTS) to MF for improved item selection. Ma et al. utilize probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) incorporating social network and rating data to address sparsity and accuracy issues. Yu et al. generalize MF with side information, employing an efficient alternative minimization procedure. Jamali et al. integrate MF with trust propagation for social network recommendations.
