Table 5 presents ACC@K (K=100) results for various latent factors (50, 100, 200, 500) comparing traditional MF and NMF with proposed decay NMF methods.  Linear and non-linear decay NMF methods generally outperformed traditional MF.  Dec_NMF-Half consistently exceeded traditional NMF on MovieLens 100K and achieved higher accuracy with latent factors 50 and 500 on MovieLens 1M, reaching peak accuracy with a latent factor of 200 on MovieLens 100K.  Dec_NMF-Full performed less well, exceeding traditional NMF only with latent factors 100 and 500 on MovieLens 100K.  Dec_NMF-Double generally outperformed traditional NMF, with the highest accuracy observed using a latent factor of 200 on MovieLens 1M.  Among linear decay methods, Dec_NMF-Full was the exception, with others generally outperforming traditional NMF.  Non-linear decay methods showed strong results, particularly Dec_NMF-Exponential, which consistently surpassed traditional NMF and achieved top accuracy on MovieLens 100K (latent factor 100) and MovieLens 1M (latent factors 50 and 100). Dec_NMF-Logistic also outperformed traditional NMF on MovieLens 100K, with peak accuracy at latent factors 50 and 500.  These results suggest a periodical regularity within the movie recommendation system, benefiting prediction accuracy.  Non-linear time decay NMFs demonstrated higher accuracy with lower latent factors.  On MovieLens 100K, traditional NMF improved with increasing latent factors, while non-linear time decay NMF consistently outperformed both linear time decay and traditional NMF. On MovieLens 1M, non-linear time decay NMF generally achieved the highest accuracy across different latent factors.
