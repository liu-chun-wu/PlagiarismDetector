Let U = {u1, u2, ..., um} be the set of users and V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} be the set of items. A rating record (rij, tij) consists of the rating value rij and rating time tij given by user ui for item vj.  The rating matrix R (m x n) comprises all rating records (rij, tij) generated by users ui ∈ U. Given R (m x n), the recommendation system's task is to predict the rating value rij ∉ R, representing items not yet rated by users.  Dec_NMF, the proposed recommendation system, incorporates three main components: time decay, non-negative matrix factorization, and prediction and recommendation.
