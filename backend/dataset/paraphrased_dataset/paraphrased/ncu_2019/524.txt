This study evaluates the ranking performance of proposed models against traditional recurrent architectures using Precision@K (P@K), Recall@K (R@K), and F1@K (F1@K).  Focusing on K=100 (due to similar trends across other K values), results are visualized in Figures 7-12.  Generally, the proposed time-decay NMF models demonstrate higher precision than traditional MF, particularly the non-linear decay variations (Figures 7 & 8). Specific examples include Dec_NMF-Half performing well in Figure 7(c) and Figure 8(a, d), Dec_NMF-Double in Figure 8(b), and Dec_NMF-Power and Dec_NMF-Exponential in Figure 8(d). Dec_NMF-Logistic consistently outperforms traditional NMF in several instances, notably Figures 7(a, c) and 8(a, c).  However, traditional MF consistently outperforms the proposed methods in recall (Figures 9 & 10).  While some proposed models achieve the lowest recall scores, Dec_NMF-Power and Dec_NMF-Exponential do not. F1 score comparisons (Figures 11 & 12) reveal strong performance for several proposed models, with Dec_NMF-Exponential achieving the highest F1 score in multiple cases and several second-highest scores.  Figures 13 & 14 explore the impact of varying latent factors. Precision generally improves with more latent factors, especially in Figure 14 at 500K, while traditional MF shows little to no improvement. Recall trends are more complex, with some proposed methods exhibiting higher recall at lower latent factor counts.  F1 score remains consistent across varying latent factors, showing significant growth at 500. While the proposed time-decay NMF models show promise in precision and F1 score, consistent superiority over traditional NMF isn't guaranteed, potentially indicating the complex relationship between dataset choice and optimal latent factor selection. The results suggest that higher latent factor counts generally lead to improved performance in the proposed methods.
