A time decay learning model processes rating records (rij, tij) in matrix R (m×n) to predict user preferences and item characteristics more realistically.  This model, Dec_NMF, preprocesses Rij(rij, tij) into R’ij(r’ij, tij) to simulate the current state.  Then, using NMF, it decomposes R’ij into latent matrices P (m×d) and Q (n×d), representing user preference and item characteristic respectively.  The prediction matrix R' is approximated by the product of P and Q.  Given a user ui and a specified number K, Dec_NMF recommends the top K items with the highest predicted values in R'.  The evaluation compares Dec_NMF with traditional MF and NMF models, addressing the impact of linear and non-linear time decay on NMF effectiveness, the incorporation of preference change, the performance of time decay leveraging models, and the applicability of Dec_NMF across diverse datasets and error metrics.  The following sections demonstrate the performance of the developed Dec_NMF recommendation system.
