Parameter tuning for the Dec_NMF models was investigated, as these models yielded the best performance.  Simply adjusting the rating or latent factors individually did not improve performance. Therefore, experiments varied the decay functions, latent factors, and training steps. Figures 7 and 8 demonstrate how increasing precision improves performance with 50 latent factors.  Latent factor size influences model complexity: larger sizes may improve data fitting, while smaller sizes can lead to local optima, and excessively large sizes may hinder parameter updates.  The final model configuration includes preprocessing with âˆ‚ = (0.00000000317 and 0.00000000139), learning rate = 0.001, training steps = (200, 300, 400, 500, and 600), and latent factors = (50, 100, 200, and 500). Evaluation shows Dec_NMF models significantly outperform traditional MF and NMF methods on two movie datasets, based on MSE, RMSE, MAE, prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  This paper proposes Dec_NMF, a novel time decay non-negative matrix factorization recommendation system. Six Dec_NMF models (Half, Full, Double, Power, Exponential, and Logistic) incorporate time and latent factor number to enhance performance. Integrating time decay functions simulates changing preferences and temporal effects, enabling Dec_NMF to capture current preferences. Experiments confirm Dec_NMF's superior performance over traditional MF and NMF.
