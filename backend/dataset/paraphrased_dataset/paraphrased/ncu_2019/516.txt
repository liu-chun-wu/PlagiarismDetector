This paper examines two types of time decay: linear and non-linear.  Figure 3 demonstrates both, simulating how human interest changes over time.  We assume that as time passes since a user's rating, their preference tends towards neutrality. Items initially liked or disliked gradually become less so, approaching a neutral state. We define this neutral state as the user's average rating (ui_avg).  Because rating habits vary, with some users consistently giving high or low scores, ui_avg represents individual neutrality.  A primary constraint on the decay function 𝑫(∆𝒕) is that it must be a decaying function, regardless of whether decay is increasing or decreasing.  This ensures 𝑫(∆𝒕) represents the concept of decay percentage in both linear and non-linear functions.  A parameter 𝛛 (ranging from 0 to 1) controls the degree of decrease, allowing us to adjust the time decay tendency, with 𝑫(∆𝒕) always falling between 0 and 1.
