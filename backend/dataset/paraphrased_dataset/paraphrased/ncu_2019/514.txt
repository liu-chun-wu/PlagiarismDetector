Kantz et al. explored the limitations of standard data analysis methods in describing the time variability of natural and social phenomena, suggesting nonlinear time series analysis as a more suitable approach.  Donner et al. presented a novel approach for analyzing complex system time series, interpreting recurrence matrices as adjacency matrices of complex networks. Bar√£o et al. compared linear (ARIMA) and nonlinear (Artificial Neural Networks) models, demonstrating the latter's potential in uncovering nonlinearity in financial data. Bursac et al. proposed a method for automating variable selection in recommendation systems, aiming for richer models by retaining confounding variables.  Ning et al. developed Sparse Linear Methods (SLIM) for Top-N recommendations, improving runtime performance and recommendation quality.  Cheng et al. introduced Sparse and Low-Rank Linear Method (Lor SLIM) for enhanced Top-N recommendation accuracy. Kabbur et al. used a nonlinear model for Top-N recommendation, outperforming existing methods. Xia et al. redefined item-to-item similarity by incorporating a mathematically defined "time decay" concept.
