Satin stitch is a simple stitching technique for filling areas like branches.  It uses parallel stitches to cover the entire shape, as illustrated in Figure 3.14.  The process begins by finding the shape's bounding box.  Stitches run perpendicular to the bounding box's long side, as shown in Figure 3.15(a), where the black arrow indicates the long side's direction and the red arrow indicates the stitch direction.  The algorithm searches along lines perpendicular to the bounding box.  A starting point is found when a point outside the shape is followed by a point inside the shape.  An ending point is found when a point inside the shape is followed by a point outside the shape. This process repeats until the entire shape is filled.  Figures 3.13 (Fishbone stitch examples) appears to be unrelated to the satin stitch description.
