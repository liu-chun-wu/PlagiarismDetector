Considering only color data for template matching proved susceptible to silhouette and noise interference.  Therefore, depth information was incorporated.  The process described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 was repeated using depth images instead of intensity images (e.g.,  𝐼∈ℝ𝑊×𝐻  became 𝐷∈ℝ𝑊×𝐻 and 𝑇𝑖∈ℝ𝑊′×𝐻′ became 𝑇𝐷𝑖∈ℝ𝑊′×𝐻′). The resulting score vector 𝐒 is defined as 𝐒= 𝛼𝐒𝑻+ 𝛽𝐒𝑫 (12), where 𝐒𝑻 represents the intensity matching score, 𝐒𝑫 represents the depth matching score, and 𝛼 and 𝛽 are weights discussed in section 4.2.4.
