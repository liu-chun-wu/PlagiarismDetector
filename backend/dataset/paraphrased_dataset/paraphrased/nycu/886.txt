Mobile device ICP inefficiency is addressed by incorporating device motion tracking.  Google Tango API's pose module provides device poses at specific timestamps, enabling depth sensor pose retrieval and transform matrix computation. The displayed point cloud (𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤), an OpenGL overlay, is calculated as: 𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤 = 𝐏𝐕𝐌𝑀𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 (28), where 𝐌 = 𝑃𝑑𝐓 (29).  𝐏, 𝐕, and 𝐌 represent the projection, view, and model matrices, respectively, forming OpenGL's MVP matrix. The model matrix comprises 𝑃𝑑 (depth pose, transforming from depth camera to OpenGL space) and 𝐓 (model pose). 𝑀𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 is the input model's origin point cloud in depth camera space.  The API also provides 𝐏 and 𝐕. The next frame's point cloud, 𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤′, is 𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤′ = 𝐏′𝐕′𝑃𝑑𝐓𝑀𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙. The next frame's depth pose (𝑃𝑑′) yields the new transform matrix and point cloud. The new model pose, 𝐓′, is calculated as 𝐓′ = 𝑃𝑑′⁻¹𝑃𝑑𝐓 (30). This new pose is used for subsequent ICP tracking or pose smoothing.  Pose measurement occurs every 𝑁 frames to monitor drift. If 𝐸𝑡𝑟𝑎 exceeds 𝑇𝐷𝑀, device motion tracking is deemed failed, reverting to ICP tracking.
