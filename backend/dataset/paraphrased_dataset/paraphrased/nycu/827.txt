To isolate the embroidery region, we use image segmentation.  We selected Otsu's method for its simplicity, efficiency, and effective results in segmenting grayscale images. This method automatically performs clustering-based image thresholding, converting a grayscale image to binary.  It determines the optimal threshold by minimizing intra-class variance and maximizing inter-class variance between the two resulting classes, as defined by: 𝜎𝑏² = 𝜔₀(𝑡)𝜔₁(𝑡)[𝜇₀(𝑡) −𝜇₁(𝑡)]² , where 𝜔₀(𝑡) represents the probability of gray levels below threshold t, 𝜔₁(𝑡) (equal to 1-𝜔₀(𝑡)) represents the probability of gray levels above t, 𝜇₀(𝑡) is the mean of gray levels below t, and 𝜇₁(𝑡) is the mean of gray levels above t.  The optimal t, maximizing this equation, is found within the range of 0 to 255.  The input image is first converted to grayscale before applying Otsu's method.  Figure 3.2 displays the segmentation results. (a) (b) (c)
