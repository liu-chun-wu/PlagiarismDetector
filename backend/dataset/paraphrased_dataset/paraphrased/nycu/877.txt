3D object template generation necessitates 3D model reconstruction. While mobile and PC applications like Constructor Developer Tool and Tango Open Constructor exist for this purpose, limitations in depth sensor resolution often produce incomplete or low-quality results.  Therefore, we employed Autodesk ReCap (professional edition's ReCap Photo or the online version). Thirty to forty images from various viewpoints were uploaded for online processing.  The resulting 3D mesh was then downloaded and further edited within ReCap, including region isolation, clipping, redundant point deletion, and scale/rotation adjustments. Figure 3 illustrates this process: (a) shows the downloaded model, and (b) the finalized, refined component.
