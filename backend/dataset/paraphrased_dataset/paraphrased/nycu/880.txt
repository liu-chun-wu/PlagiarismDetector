Object pose recognition is achieved using a normalized cross-correlation algorithm, accelerated by vectorizing the template and image patch for computation as a dot product. This method, proposed by Cao et al. [2016], is detailed in section 4.2.1, with further calculation speed improvements described in section 4.2.2.  Accuracy enhancements are presented in sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4.
