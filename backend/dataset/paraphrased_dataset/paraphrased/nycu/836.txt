Fiber appearance is primarily characterized by strong, anisotropic highlights and translucency.  Common fiber scattering can be simplified into three components: direct surface reflection (R), light transmitted through the fibers (TT), and back-scattered light from internal reflections (TRT). The white highlights seen are caused by the R component, while blue highlights result from the TRT component.  We used Mitsuba renderer, a physically based renderer with a surface scattering model similar to fiber scattering properties.
