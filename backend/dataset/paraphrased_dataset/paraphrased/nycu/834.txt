The flower stitch, also known as "taozhen (套針)" in Chinese, is used for embroidering circular shapes like small flowers.  It is worked from the edge to the center. While Figure 3.16 illustrates the flower stitch, Figures 3.15(a), (b), and (c) depict satin stitch modeling of a branch: contour, stitch locations and directions, and the final embroidered model, respectively.  Similar to the fishbone stitch, the center point is calculated using image moments, as shown in Figure 3.17(a).  Small, equidistant steps are taken along the shape's edge (illustrated by the distance between the two arrows in Figure 3.17(a)), recording the start and end points of each stitch. To avoid excessive density at the center, stitches are alternated: the first ends at the center, the second at 1/3 of the radius from the center, the third at the center, and so on.  The final result is shown in Figure 3.17.
