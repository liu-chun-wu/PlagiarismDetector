Otsu's segmentation results, shown in Figure 3.3(a), contain noise and small objects in the foreground. To address this, morphological opening is used. This operation removes small foreground objects and widens narrow gaps between objects connected by thin pixel bridges.  Morphology is a set of image processing operations based on shapes.  Dilation and erosion are fundamental morphological operations. Dilation adds pixels to object boundaries, while erosion removes them. Opening, defined in Equation (2), dilates the erosion of set A by structuring element B, where Θ and ⊕ represent erosion and dilation, respectively.  Opening is similar to erosion, removing foreground pixels from region edges, but is generally less destructive. Figure 3.3 displays the results before and after opening.  Noise and small objects are removed, and gaps between the flower and other objects are widened.  (Figure 3.2: Image segmentation results. (a) Input color image. (b) Grayscale image.
