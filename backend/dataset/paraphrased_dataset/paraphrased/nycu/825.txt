This thesis simulates embroidery through image processing, stitch modeling, stitch placement, and rendering.  The system (Figure 3.1) first processes an input image, converting it to grayscale, segmenting it using Otsu's method, and applying morphological opening to reduce noise.  Contour extraction follows.  Next, stitch modeling generates high-quality stitches based on a procedural yarn model, modifying stitch endpoints to simulate fabric penetration. Stitch placement then utilizes embroidery techniques, implementing fishbone, satin, and flower stitch styles.  Finally, physically-based rendering, informed by the light scattering properties of thread fiber and employing global illumination, produces realistic embroidery results.
