Because color and depth influence template matching differently for each object, fixed weights in equation (12) are not always optimal.  Assuming that greater variation between template viewpoints indicates more information, we use entropy to determine color and depth weights.  We select one color and one depth template every N templates (N = total number of templates) and calculate the similarity scores between every pair within this subset.  Color scores are represented as 𝑋𝑐= {𝑥1𝑐, 𝑥2𝑐, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛𝑐} and depth scores as 𝑋𝑑= {𝑥1𝑑, 𝑥2𝑑, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛𝑑}, where 𝑛=10.  Each 𝑥𝑖𝑗 is normalized as 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = (𝑥𝑖𝑗−min𝑥𝑗) / (max𝑥𝑗−min𝑥𝑗).  Entropy 𝐸𝑗 is defined as 𝐸𝑗= −(∑(𝑦𝑖𝑗 * ln 𝑦𝑖𝑗))/ln(𝑛), where 𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 𝑥𝑖𝑗 / (∑𝑥𝑖𝑗) represents the proportion of index 𝑖 of term 𝑗.  After calculating color entropy 𝐸𝑐 and depth entropy 𝐸𝑑,  the entropy weights for equation (12) are calculated as 𝛼= 𝐸𝑐 / (2−(𝐸𝑐+𝐸𝑑)) and 𝛽= 𝐸𝑑 / (2−(𝐸𝑐+𝐸𝑑)).
