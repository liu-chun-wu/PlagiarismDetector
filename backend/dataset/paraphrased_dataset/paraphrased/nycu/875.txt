This system comprises three sections.  The first section reconstructs offline 3D models and renders their 2D templates. Reference images are generated via computer graphics rendering, forming a template matrix.  The second section handles online processing: foreground extraction, object recognition, and 3D pose tracking using color and depth data from the mobile device's RGB-D cameras. Object recognition employs template matching based on the VNCC algorithm. Upon successful object detection, the ICP tracking algorithm updates the object's pose for each frame.  The final section displays the input model using the pose calculated in the second section.
