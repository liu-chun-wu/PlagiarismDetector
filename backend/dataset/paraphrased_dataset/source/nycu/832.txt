Fishbone stitch as shown in Figure 3.12 is a commonly used stitching style. It is Figure 3.10: Front view of stitch model, before and after modification Figure 3.11: Modified stitch model (a) front view (b) side view (a) (b) widely used in leaves, feathers, or wings. This stitch divides the shape into two parts by middle line, and then sew from middle line to edge parallelly with a fixed angle. First, we calculate the center point(the black point in Figure 3.13(a) and orientation(the black arrow in Figure3.13(a) of the given shape. With center point and orientation we can know where the center line is, because people usually sew from center line to edge. We calculate the center point and orientation by image moment of the area. Image moment is a certain particular weighted average (moment) of the image pixels' intensities. Simple properties of the image which are found via image moments includes area (or total intensity), its centroid, and information about its orientation. Image moment 𝑀𝑖𝑗 are calculated by 𝑀𝑖𝑗= ∑∑𝑥𝑖𝑦𝑗𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦) 𝑦 𝑥 , where I(x,y) is the pixel intensity. The coordinate of centroid is 𝑥̅ = 𝑀10 𝑀00 , 𝑦̅ = 𝑀01 𝑀00. image orientation can be derived by first using the second order central moments 𝜇20 ′ = 𝑀20 𝑀00 −𝑥̅2, 𝜇02 ′ = 𝑀02 𝑀00 −𝑦̅2, 𝜇11 ′ = 𝑀11 𝑀00 −𝑥̅𝑦̅, then the angle θ = 2 arctan ( 2𝜇11 ′ 𝜇20 ′ −𝜇02 ′ ) Then, we rotate 60 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise based on the Figure 3.12: A leaf embroidered by fishbone stitch orientation of the shape to determine the stitch’s direction as red arrow shown in Figure 3.13(a). Because people usually stitch in this angle, approximately 60 degree to center line. Finally, we start from the center line, searching along stitch’s direction, and get the end point on the edge. We record the coordinate of the start point and end point. We repeat this step until the shape is filled. (a) (b) (c)
