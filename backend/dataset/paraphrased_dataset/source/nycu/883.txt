Since the influence of color and depth are different for each object in template matching, we cannot always get better results with fixed weights in equation (12). We suppose that the greater variation between different viewpoints of template, the data provides more information. We suppose that the greater the difference between the template data from different viewpoints can be, the more information it can provide. Therefore, we use the entropy method to determine the color and depth weights. We pick one template every N templates both color and depth templates, where N = 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 , and calculate the similarity score of any two templates within the five templates we pick. The scores of color are defined as 𝑋𝑐= {𝑥1𝑐, 𝑥2𝑐, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛𝑐}, and the scores of is defined as 𝑋𝑑= {𝑥1𝑑, 𝑥2𝑑, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛𝑑}, where 𝑛= 10, and the normalized of 𝑥𝑖𝑗 is 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , = 𝑥𝑖𝑗−min𝑥𝑗 max𝑥𝑗−min𝑥𝑗. The entropy 𝐸 is defined as 𝐸𝑗= − ln(𝑛) ∑ 𝑦𝑖𝑗ln 𝑦𝑖𝑗 𝑛 𝑖=1 ,                        (13) where 𝑦𝑖𝑗= 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , ∑ 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , 𝑛 𝑖=1 is the proportion of index 𝑖 of 𝑗 term. We calculate the color entropy 𝐸𝑐 and the depth entropy 𝐸𝑑, and then get the entropy weights used in equation (12) 𝛼= 𝐸𝑐 2−(𝐸𝑐+𝐸𝑑),                           (14) 𝛽= 𝐸𝑑 2−(𝐸𝑐+𝐸𝑑).
