In order to get the region we want to embroider, we have to segment the input image. There are a lot of methods proposed in image segmentation area. We choose Otsu’s method [10] to segment the grayscale image not only it is a simple and efficient method, but also it can generate good result. Otsu’s method is used to automatically perform clustering-based image thresholding or, the reduction of a gray level image to a binary image. It calculates the optimum threshold separating the image into two classes so that their intra-class variance is minimal, and their inter-class variance is maximal, as shown in Equation (1). 𝜎𝑏 2 = 𝜔0(𝑡)𝜔1(𝑡)[𝜇0(𝑡) −𝜇1(𝑡)]2 (1) where 𝜔0(𝑡)  is the probability of gray level smaller than t, and 𝜔1(𝑡)  is the probability of gray level larger than t, that is 1 −𝜔0(𝑡). 𝜇0(𝑡) is the mean of gray levels smaller than t, and 𝜇1(𝑡) is the mean of gray levels larger than t. We need to find a t between 0 and 255 such that Equation (1) is maximized. Before performing Otsu’s method, we first convert the input image to a grayscale image. Figure 3.2 shows the result of image segmentation. (a)                      (b)                     (c)
