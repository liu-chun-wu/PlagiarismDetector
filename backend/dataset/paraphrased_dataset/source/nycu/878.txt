We generated the reference images by rendering the reconstructed 3D model in different views. The models can be classified into two types: general and symmetric. The general model is representative of the asymmetric model, and the symmetric model is representative of the model that is rotational symmetry about one of three coordinate axes. We sets 5 samples in y- axis and 5 samples in x-axis on a hemisphere as viewpoints of a general model. For a symmetry model, we sets 13 samples on a semi-circle as viewpoints. The viewpoints can be considered as the out-plane rotation, and for each viewpoint, we renders 24 samples, 15 degrees apart, in z- axis, which can be considered as the in-plane rotation. The illustration displayed in Figure 3. Figure 4. Two types of models and their reference images. (a) A model in the general type. The x-axis is red, y- axis is green and z-axis is blue. The number of the viewpoints is 25 in total. (b) A model in the symmetric type. The viewpoints are sampled on a semi-circle and the number of the vertices is 13. (c) Examples of the reference images generated in (a) and there are 24 images in total for the in-plane rotation.. Chapter4. Foreground Segmentation and Object Pose Recognition This chapter describes the object recognition and pose estimation algorithm in online processing section. Before the matching processing, we should extracts the foreground to get the target object, which will describe in section 4.1. In the section 4.2, we will describe our object recognition algorithm. Section 4.3 shows how to check and revise the reverse pose problem of matching result. Figure 4 shows the flow chart of detecting state. Figure 5. The flow chart of detecting state
