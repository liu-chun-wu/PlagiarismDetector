The flower stitch is also called “taozhen(套針)” in Chinese. This stich is usually used to embroider circle-like shapes, such as small flowers. It sews from the edge to the center of the shape, as shown in Figure 3.16. Figure 3.15: Satin stitch modeling (a) branch contour (b) stitches’ locations and directions of branches (c) branch embroidery model (a) (b) (c) Figure 3.16: Flower stitch First, we calculate the center point of the shape by image moment as mentioned in fishbone stitch. The center point(black point) is shown in Figure 3.17(a) Then, along the shape’s edge, we shift small distance every time as shown in Figure 3.17(a) (the distance between two arrows), and record the start point and end point. But there is a problem that if all the stitches end at the center point, the shape’s center will be too dense. So when the first stitch end at the center, the second one end at 1/3 radius to the center, the third one end at center, the fourth one end at 1/3 radius to center. The rest stitches can be done in the same manner. The result can be seen in Figure 3.17.
