Because generating the templates of the physical object for matching is in demand, we have to reconstruct the 3D models of objects we need. For reconstructing 3D models of physical objects, there are many applications not only on PCs but also on mobile devices, such as Constructor Developer Tool [Tango Experiments] and Tango Open Constructor [Luboš Vonásek]. However, with low resolution of depth sensor and other technical difficulties, reconstructing results are always incomplete or not fine enough for template matching. Thus, we used a commercial tool called Autodesk ReCap [Autodesk], which includes ReCap Photo in professional edition or use ReCap online [Autodesk] version. Uploading thirty to forty photos of the object in different viewpoints to ReCap online sever. After the online process of 3D reconstruction is completed, the model mesh of specified file types can be downloaded. Autodesk ReCap can also use to edit 3D meshes. The modifications include isolating the limited region to mesh, clipping and deleting redundant points, and redefining the scale and rotation. Figure 3. The example for the 3D model reconstruction. (a) The download model in the ReCap Photo. (b) The final model of the complete component without the redundant meshes.
