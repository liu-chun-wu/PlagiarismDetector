The appearance of fibers is typically dominated by two prominent features: strong, distinctive anisotropic highlights and translucency [11]. For common fibers, scattering can be approximated by a direct surface reflection component (R), light that gets transmitted through the fibers (TT) and back-scattered light that got internally reflected (TRT), as shown in Figure 3.18(a). The white highlights that we see in the Figure 3.18(b) is caused by R component, the blue highlight is caused by TRT component. We render the model in Mitsuba renderer which is a physically based renderer. In Mitsuba renderer, there is a surface scattering model which is similar to the fiber scattering property. So we choose this BSDF model, as shown in Figure 3.19. Figure 3.18: Fiber scattering model (Courtesy of Schroder) (a) light scattering component.
