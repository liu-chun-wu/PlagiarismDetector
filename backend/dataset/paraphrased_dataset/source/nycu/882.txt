We found that if we only consider the color data, the silhouette and noise easily influenced the matching result. Therefore, we also take the depth information into consideration for template matching. We repeat the steps in 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, changing the intensity image to depth image, such as 𝐼∈ℝ𝑊×𝐻  to 𝐷∈ℝ𝑊×𝐻  and 𝑇𝑖∈ℝ𝑊′×𝐻′  to 𝑇𝐷𝑖∈ℝ𝑊′×𝐻′ . The score vector 𝐒 defined in equation (11) can be rewritten as 𝐒= 𝛼𝐒𝑻+ 𝛽𝐒𝑫,                          (12) where 𝐒𝑻 is the intensity matching score, 𝐒𝑫 is the depth matching score, 𝛼 and 𝛽 are the weights, which will defined in section 4.2.4.
