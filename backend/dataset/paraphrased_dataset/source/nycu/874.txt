Along with the development in mobile devices, the number of mobile applications grow rapidly. There are also quite a few researches that aim of improving the traditional techniques or proposing new purposes to make them applicable to mobile devices. Hagbi et al. [2009] presented a recognition and camera pose estimation from planar shapes named Nestor. They use contour concavities to extract features for real-time pose estimation and tracking, and a nonlinear optimizer for refining the calculated pose to the desired level of accuracy. Seo et al. [2011] proposed a model-based tracking using a 3D model of an object on a target scene, which estimated the camera motion through edge detection and matching and said that the approach was the first work that based on the Android platform. Maidi et al. [2013] presented a tracking system for object recognition in real-life environments with computing SURF keypoints of natural features in the image. Mohammed and Morris [2014] prebuilt a 2D histogram of captured image under different lighting conditions using the Hue and Saturation of the HSV colour space, and tracking the Emergency Exit sign using Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMShift), which using colour features for tracking. Though there are many proposed methods, most cases are still based on specific features. In this paper, our object detection method is based on [Cao et al. 2016], which reduces the computation in template matching and can deal with textureless objects, and then the extension of ICP as our tracking method.
