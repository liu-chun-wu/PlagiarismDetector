The ICP align source and target two point clouds through finding optimal rotation 𝑅 and translation 𝑡. Assume that source point set 𝒫= {𝑝𝑖}, 𝑖= 1, 2, ⋯, 𝑛, where 𝑛 is the number of points of 𝒫, and target point set 𝒬= {𝑞𝑗}, 𝑗= 1, 2, ⋯, 𝑚, where 𝑚 is the number of points of 𝒬, and 𝑝𝑖, 𝑞𝑗∈ℝ3. The ICP search for the minimal Euclidean distance, see equation (19), of point pairs 𝑝𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 for all the points in the source point sets, the corresponding point of ip  is defined as equation (20), 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑝𝑖, 𝑞𝑗) = ‖𝑝𝑖− 𝑞𝑗‖ = √(𝑥𝑝𝑖− 𝑥𝑞𝑗) + (𝑦𝑝𝑖− 𝑦𝑞𝑗) + (𝑧𝑝𝑖− 𝑧𝑞𝑗) , (19) 𝑞𝑗 𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑞𝑗∈𝒬 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑝𝑖, 𝑞𝑗).                   (20) The main objective function of ICP is defined below, 𝐸(𝑅, 𝑡) = ∑ ‖𝑅𝑝𝑖+ 𝑡−𝑞𝑗‖ 𝑛 𝑖=1 .                 (21) We also proposed a Bidirectional-ICP method, which is extended from the ICP algorithm, for searching the corresponding points in two direction. That is to say, the ICP not only find the corresponding point 𝑞𝑗∈𝒬 for 𝑝𝑖, but also find the corresponding point 𝑝𝑖∈𝒫 for 𝑞𝑗. And a new set 𝒞= {𝑐𝑘} , 𝑘= 1, 2, ⋯, 𝑁 , where 𝑁  is the number of bidirectional corresponding point pairs. If the closest point 𝑞𝑗 𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑞𝑗∈𝒬 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑝𝑖, 𝑞𝑗)  of 𝑝𝑖  and the closest point 𝑝𝑖 𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑝𝑖∈𝒫 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑞𝑗, 𝑝𝑖) of 𝑞𝑗 are equal to each other, we say that they are corresponding points, and the 𝑐𝑘= (𝑖, 𝑗) stores the point index from 𝒫 and 𝒬 respectively. Hence, equation (21) is modified to find the minimum distance of all corresponding point pairs in set 𝒞, 𝐸(𝑅, 𝑡) = ∑ ‖𝑅𝑝𝑐𝑘𝑖+ 𝑡−𝑞𝑐𝑘𝑗‖ 𝑁 𝑘=1 .                (22) To find the corresponding points in two directions, the K-d tree is also utilized for rising the searching speed.
