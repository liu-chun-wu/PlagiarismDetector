In this process, we simulate the effect that stitch sews in and out of fabric. Because after stitch modeling, the stitch model we get is straight as shown in Figure 3.9. Actually, in real embroidery, the stitch goes into and out of fabric, which generate “arc” at the endpoints because of the interaction force between stitch and fabric. In order to simulate this “arc” effect, we are going to modify the endpoints of stitch. Our method is straight forward. Assume that the gray rectangle is the front view of the stitch model as shown in Figure 3.10. We just consider the shape of end part as 1/4 circle as the black arc shown in Figure 3.10. So the shape can be formulized by the equation below: (𝑑−∆𝑥)2 + 𝑦2 = 𝑑2 (y>0, ∆𝑥<d) (8) where d is the diameter of stitch’s cross section, ∆𝑥 is the distance to the endpoint in X direction, y is the Y coordinate of the new shape. We can simplify the equation as y = √2∆𝑥𝑑−∆𝑥2 (9) (a) front view (b) side view Figure 3.9: “straight” stitch In implemention, we just calculate ∆y = d −y, and use the y-coordinate of vertex of fiber to minus ∆y. After shape modification we can get the modified shape as shown in Figure 3.11.
