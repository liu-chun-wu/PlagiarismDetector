After Otsu’s segmentation, there are still some noise and small objects in the foreground region, as shown in Figure 3.3(a). In order to solve this problem, we use morphological opening to remove small objects from the foreground and open up narrow gaps between objects connected by a thin bridge of pixels. Morphology is a broad set of image processing operations that process images based on shapes. The most basic morphological operations are dilation and erosion. Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image, while erosion removes pixels on object boundaries. Opening is the dilation of the erosion of a set A by a structuring element B, as shown in Equation (2). where Θ and ⊕ denote erosion and dilation, respectively. The basic effect of an opening is somewhat like erosion in that it tends to remove some of the foreground pixels from the edges of regions of foreground pixels. However it is less destructive than erosion in general. (2) Figure 3.2: The result of image segmentation. (a) input color image. (b) grayscale image. (c) segmented image. Figure 3.3 shows the result before and after doing morphological opening. We can see the noise and small objects are removed, and the gaps between flower and object are opened up.
