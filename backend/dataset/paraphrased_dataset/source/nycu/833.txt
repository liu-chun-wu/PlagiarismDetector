Satin stitch is an easy stitching style that can be used to fill areas, such as branches. It covers the whole shape by a series of parallel stitches, as shown in Figure 3.14 Figure 3.13: Fishbone stitch modeling (a) the contour of a leaf (b) stitch location and direction of the leaf (c) leaf embroidery model Figure 3.14: Satin stitch First, we get the bounding box of the shape. The stitchâ€™s direction is perpendicular to the direction of long side of bounding box as shown in Figure 3.15(a), the black arrow is the direction of long side, the red arrow is the direction of stitch. Then, we search along the line which is perpendicular to the direction of bounding box. If the prior point is out of the shape and the next point is in the shape, the current point is the start point. If the prior point is in the shape and the next point is out of the shape, the current point is the end point. Repeat until all the shape is covered.
