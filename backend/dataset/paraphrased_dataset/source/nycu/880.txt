Our object pose recognition algorithm is based on framing normalized cross-correlation and the computation time speeds up by vectorizing the template and image patch, which can be written as a simple dot product. The method is proposed by Cao et al. [2016]. In section 4.2.1, we will introduce the method detail, and a further development to speed up calculation will show in section 4.2.2. Section 4.2.3 and section 4.2.4 are the algorithm improvements to enhance the accuracy in matching results.
