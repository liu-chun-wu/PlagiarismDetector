In this step, we get the outmost contours of the binary image we processed before. If a contour is small enough, we will delete it, because it is not belong to the major object we want to embroider. Finally, we get the contour image of the flower, as shown in Figure 3.4(b) Figure 3.4: Find contours (a) binary image with many objects (b) contour image (a) (b) Figure 3.3: The result of morphological operation. (a) segmented image. (b) result of doing morphological opening.
