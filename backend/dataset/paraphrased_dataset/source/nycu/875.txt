Figure 2. Overview of the whole system Our system can be mainly divided into three sections as shown in Figure 1. The first section includes offline 3D models reconstruction and rendering the 2D templates of 3D models. We generate all reference images by computer graphics rendering, and then build the template matrix. The second section is online processing, which includes foreground extraction, object recognition and pose tracking in three-dimensional space using color and depth information from RGB-D cameras in the mobile device. We recognize the object by the template-matching method based on VNCC [Cao et al. 2016] algorithm. If the system detects the object successfully, followed by the ICP tracking algorithm to update the object pose for each frame. The last section is the display of the input model with the pose obtained from section two.
