In this paper, we have three non-linear time decay function including 1) power time decay function 2) exponential decay function 3) logistic decay function. Especially, all non-linear time decay function all are smoother than linear. Fig. 5 demonstrate the different three non-linear time decay function. D(Δt) =  1  -  ( 0.5 ∙∂ ∙  Δt  ) (3) Figure 5 The demonstration of non-linear time decay function. The pseudo code is given in Algorithm 2. (Definition 2 Non-linear time decay) Given a rating matrix R (mn) consists of all records (rij, tij), with current time cur_time, each user’s rating average ui_avg and time decay function D. The time decay matrix R’(mn) consist of all users uiU time decay rating r’ij have been generated by time decay function. As follow of algorithm 2, we need to distinguish rating rij from each user’s average ui_avg(line 3and 6, Algorithom2). Because we need to recognize that rating whether increase or decrease to the neutrality. If rij bigger than ui_avg which means that rating will decrease by time, and vice versa. Notice that due to non-linear time decay function only make rating approach to neutrality, that is the reason why we don’t need to confirm that whether the rating cross over the neutrality. Algorithm 2 : Non-linear time decay Input: R: rating matrix cur_time : current time; tij: rating time ; ui_avg:  uiU rating average; D: non-linear time decay function; Output:  r’ij:  ui time decay rating 01: Δt: cur_time – tij 02: for each ( ui ,rij ) ∈ R do 03:  if (rij > ui_avg)    //  rating will decrease by time 04:    // decay value over neutrality 05:    r’ij  ← (D(Δt) * (rij - ui_avg)) + ui_avg) 06:  else (rij < ui_avg)   //  rating will increase by time 07:    r’ij  ←  (-D(Δt) * (ui_avg - rij) + ui_avg) 08: end 09: output   r’ij ∈R’; In this paper, we detail three non-linear time decay functions as follows. Δt is from rating start time to now to simulate the decay degree. 4) Power time decay Here we use a power function to simulate the time decay as follows. D(Δt) =    0.67∂∙𝛥𝑡 (4) In Equation 4, comparing with linear time decay functions, power time decay function has more smooth curve. Also, the larger ∂ is, the stronger of the time decay’s effectiveness is. 5) Exponential time decay We use an exponential function to simulate the time decay as follows. D(Δt) = −2 (1+exp(−∂∙𝛥𝑡)) + 2 (5) In Equation 5, comparing with Equation 4., we choice the exponential to let user’s rating decay to be smoother to the neutrality. The larger ∂ is, the stronger of the time decay’s effectiveness is. 6) Logistic time decay We use a logistic function to simulate the time decay as follows. In Equation 3, we decelerate the decay rate by logistic function to let user’s rating decay comparing with exponential time decay function to be smoother to the neutrality. The larger ∂ is, the stronger of the time decay’s effectiveness is. For all time decay function, Fig 6. show each time decay function how smooth is. D(Δt) = 1+𝑒−𝜕∙Δ𝑡+ 1.5 (6) Figure 6 Comparison of linear and non-linear time decay
