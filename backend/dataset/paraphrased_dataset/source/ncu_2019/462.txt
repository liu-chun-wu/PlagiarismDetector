本小節將會比較Baseline 和並列式集成特徵選取的屬性集合，Baseline 為無進行 任何特徵選取，其屬性集合即為原始的特徵數量，並列式集成特徵選取則是會將不同 特徵選取演算法所產生的特徵子集集成形成最終特徵子集，其架構可以參考3.4 實驗 架構中的圖3-8，其屬性集合即為最終特徵子集的特徵數量，藉由下表4-16 可以比較 20 個資料集經由不同特徵選取方法後，所選取之特徵數量和比例。 表4- 16 Baseline 與並列式集成特徵選取後之特徵數量與比例 特徵選取方法 Baseli ne 交集 聯集 多重交集 C4.5+PC A C4.5+GA PCA+GA PCA+GA +C4.5 C45+PCA C45+GA PCA+GA PCA+GA +C4.5 PCA+GA +C4.5 SPECTF (65.91%) (63.64%) (43.18%) (40.91%) (100.00%) (100.00%) (90.91%) (100.00%) (90.91%) segmentationData (79.31%) (87.93%) (70.69%) (70.69%) (100.00%) (100.00%) (96.55%) (100.00%) (96.55%) Sonar (43.33%) (25.00%) (43.33%) (21.67%) 52 (86.67%) (81.67%) (93.33%) (96.67%) (68.33%) MEU-Mobile KSD 2016 (77.46%) (59.15%) (40.85%) (40.85%) (100.00%) (100.00%) (95.77%) (100.00%) (95.77%) urban_land_cover (50.34%) (40.14%) (55.78%) (36.05%) (83.67%) (85.03%) (93.20%) (93.88%) (74.15%) MUSK_Clean1 (45.78%) (34.34%) (51.81%) (29.52%) (86.14%) (85.54%) (95.18%) (96.99%) (72.89%) SCADI 8 (3.90%) 11 (5.37%) (21.95%) (2.93%) (30.24%) (80.98%) (84.88%) (85.37%) 52 (25.37%) Arrhythmia (19.42%) (11.51%) (43.53%) (10.79%) (80.58%) (64.03%) (91.73%) (91.73%) (52.88%) Madelon (47.00%) (40.20%) (62.60%) (36.00%) (84.80%) (91.60%) (97.40%) (98.00%) (77.80%) Secom X 1 (0.18%) 35 (6.21%) X 44 (7.80%) (78.55%) (79.96%) (79.96%) (6.38%) gastroentrology 4 (0.57%) 8 (1.15%) (14.47%) 4 (0.57%) (18.19%) (80.95%) (83.52%) (83.81%) (15.04%) ORL 1024 68 (6.64%) 56 (5.47%) (25.29%) 53 (5.18%) (31.54%) (80.96%) (85.25%) (85.35%) (27.05%) colon X 2 (0.10%) 42 (2.10%) X 51 (2.55%) (81.45%) (81.80%) (81.80%) 44 (2.20%) oh15.wc (3.32%) 96 (3.10%) (18.94%) 80 (2.58%) (24.13%) (83.00%) (86.81%) (86.87%) (20.19%) oh10.wc 3238 78 (2.41%) 84 (2.59%) (20.88%) 61 (1.88%) (26.81%) (82.49%) (86.81%) (87.00%) (22.11%) leukemia 1 (0.01%) 3 (0.04%) 47 (0.66%) 1 (0.01%) (0.83%) (80.95%) (81.09%) (81.09%) 40 (0.57%) Amazon_initial_50_30_1 (2.27%) (1.89%) (9.79%) (1.88%) (11.88%) (81.64%) (83.33%) (83.33%) (10.19%) orlraws10P 10304 1 (0.01%) 2 (0.02%) 56 (0.54%) 1 (0.01%) (0.80%) (82.08%) (82.31%) (82.32%) (0.55%) CLL_SUB_111 11340 1 (0.01%) 4 (0.04%) 73 (0.64%) 1 (0.01%) (0.81%) (81.19%) (81.31%) (81.32%) (0.67%) SMK_CAN_187 19993 2 (0.01%) 2 (0.01%) (0.60%) 2 (0.01%) 150 (0.75%) (80.85%) (81.01%) (81.01%) (0.60%) 全部平均 22.39% 19.09% 26.69% 15.08% 43.91% 84.15% 87.61% 88.82% 38.01% （表格來源：本研究）
