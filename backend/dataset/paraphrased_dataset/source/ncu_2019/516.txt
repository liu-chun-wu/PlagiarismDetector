In this paper, we have two kind of time decay including 1) linear time decay and 2) non-linear time decay Fig. 3 present the linear time decay and non-linear time decay that simulate the human interest behavior. We assume that the longer the user’s rating, the closer it will be to neutrality because of changes in user’s preference. The item which user liked may become less like, and the item that user didn't like become less like, and then approach the neutral state. According to assume, we set the neutral Figure 2 The architecture of time decay NMF recommendation system. state as user’s rating average ui_avg which can represent the user’s neutrality. Because each user has different rating habits, some users are used to rating high score, and vice versa. On the principle of time decay’s effect, there is a primary constraints of 𝑫(∆𝒕): No matter increasing or decreasing decay, constraint (i) ensures every 𝑫(𝚫𝒕) is a “decaying” function which represent the concept of decay percentage in linear and non-linear time decay function. We set a parameter 𝛛∈[𝟎, 𝟏] as independent variable to determine the decrease degree. Therefore, we can control the time decay tendency.
