Let U= {u1, u2, ..., um} be a set of users and V= {v1, v2, ..., vn} be a set of items. A rating record is a pair (rij, tij) where rij and tij denote the rating value and the rating time generated by user ui for item vj, respectively. A rating matrix R (mn) consists of all rating records (rij, tij) have been generated by uiU. Given a rating matrix R (mn), the task of recommendation system is to predict the rating value rij  R, i.e., the items that have not yet been rated by users. 3. Proposed Recommendation System: Dec_NMF Fig. 2 presents the architecture of Dec_NMF which consists of three major components: 1) Time decay, 2) Non-negative matrix factorization, 3) Prediction and recommendation.
