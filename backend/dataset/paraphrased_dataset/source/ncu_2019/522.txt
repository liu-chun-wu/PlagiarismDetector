Obviously, we know that evaluating a model good or not need matrices to prove whether model is suitable for. To response four research questions above, we provide the MSE RMSE MAE results in Table 2, 3, 4. Experiment compares our proposed methods with traditional MF and NMF. In Table 2, 3, 4, we can observe that the effectiveness of linear or non-linear decay NMF methods are totally better than traditional MF. Linear decay NMF latent factor 50,200,500, we can show better MSE RMSE MAE comparing with traditional NMF in Table 2, 3, 4. Especially in Table 2, 3, 4, Dec_NMF-Full got the lowest MSE RMSE MAE in latent factor 50,200 MovieLens 100K 1M. Besides Dec_NMF-Full good effectiveness, Dec_NMF-Double in Table 2, 3, 4 got lowest MSE RMSE MAE in latent factor 500 MovieLens 100K and latent factor 50 MovieLens 1M. In non- linear decay NMF in Table 2, 3, 4, we can observe that MSE RMSE MAE are almost better than traditional NMF except for latent factor 100. Especially in high latent factor 200,500 in Table 2, 3, 4, we can definitely confirm that the MSE RMSE MAE of non-linear decay NMF is better than traditional NMF. On the other hand, Dec_NMF-Power in Table 2, 3, 4 got the lowest MSE RMSE MAE in latent factor 200,500 MovieLens 1M. Also Dec_NMF-Logistic in Table 2, 3, 4 got the lowest MSE RMSE MAE in latent factor 50 MovieLens1M. Except for traditional MF, NMF in Table 2 got three highest MSE in latent factor 200 MovieLens 100 K, MovieLens 100 K latent factor 500 and MovieLens 1M latent factor 500, three highest RMSE in Table 3 in MovieLens 100 K latent factor 200, MovieLens 1M latent factor 500, MovieLens 1M latent factor 500, two highest MAE in Table 4 in MovieLens 100 K latent factor 50 and MovieLens 100 K latent factor 200, respectively. This show that propose methods may be more suitable for reality. Generally speaking, we also can see that except traditional MF and NMF, no matter MSE RMSE MAE in Table 2, 3, 4, linear decay NMF got the hightest values. Although linear time decay NMF’s effectiveness are better than traditional MF and NMF. It may represent that faster decay rate converging to neutrality is not really match the reality. Besides traditional NMF and linear time decay NMF, we observe that non-linear time decay NMF got highest value in MAE as well in Table 4. It may represent that smoother time decay rate which converge to neutrality comparing to other NMF models is not suitable for low latent factor. Especially no matter in MSE RMSE MAE in Table 2, 3, 4 comparing with other NMF methods, exponential decay NMF ‘s effectiveness all perform well.
