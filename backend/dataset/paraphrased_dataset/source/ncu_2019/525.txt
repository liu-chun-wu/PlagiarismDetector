We also investigate the impact of Dec_NMF models parameters since it has the best performance results. Obviously, different parameter setting may lead to different performances. During experiments, we found that only decreasing rating or setting a latent factor does not help improving model performance. Hence we perform more experiments in varying the decay functions, latent factors and training step. In Fig. 7, 8 we show how increasing precision improves the performance of propose Dec_NMF models in term of latent factors 50. Definitely, the latent factor quality determines the model complexity. The latent factor quality with a larger size may fit the data better; moreover, a small latent factor number size may lead to local optimum, while a big one may lead to insufficient updating of parameters in our proposed models. In summary, we conclude our model setting as follows: we set preprocessing, while ∂ = (0.00000000317 and 0.00000000139), learning rate = 0.001, training step = (200, 300, 400, 500 and 600) and latent factor number = (50, 100, 200 and 500). We conclude the evaluation section that Dec_NMF models significantly outperforms traditional MF and NMF method on two different movie data in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAE, prediction accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we investigated the challenges of NMF prediction. We proposed a novel NMF recommendation system, time decay non-negative matrix factorization (Dec_NMF), for predicting the item. Including the time and latent factor number, six NMF models, Dec_NMF- Half, Dec_NMF- Full, Dec_NMF- Double, Dec_NMF- Power, Dec_NMF- Exponential and Dec_NMF- Logistic are developed to enhance the performance of the based non-negative matrix factorization. Specifically, by integrating time decay function into NMF model process, the time decay NMF enables a practical approach to simulate human preference change and temporal decay values. As a consequence, Dec_NMF can capture the current preference in the prediction process. The detailed experiments on two real-life movie datasets demonstrate that Dec_NMF significantly outperform traditional MF and NMF Reference [1] Barão, S. M. M. (2008).
