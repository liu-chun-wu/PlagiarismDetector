Firstly, to response four research questions above, we provide the result of ACC@K with K = {100} and different latent factors {50, 100, 200, 500} in Table 5. Experiment compares our proposed methods with traditional MF and NMF. In ACC Table 5, we can observe that no doubt the performance of linear or non- linear decay NMF methods are better than traditional MF. In Dec_NMF-Half MovieLens 100K, all accuracy values are better than traditional NMF. Besides good accuracy in MovieLens 100K, Dec_NMF-Half got higher accuracy than traditional NMF in latent factor 50, 500 MovieLens 1M. Especially Dec_NMF-Half used in latent factor 200 MovieLens 100K got the highest accuracy. However, Dec_NMF-Full do not meet our expected accuracy. Because only two accuracies are better than traditional NMF in latent factor100 and 500 MovieLens 100K. The accuracy of Dec_NMF-Double most are better than traditional NMF. Especially Dec_NMF-Double got the highest accuracy in latent factor200 MovieLens 1M. As a whole, the accuracy of linear decay NMF methods are better than traditional NMF except the Dec_NMF-Full. On the other hand, the accuracy of non-linear decay NMF got good results definitely. The accuracies of Dec_NMF-Exponential are all better than traditional NMF particularly. Dec_NMF- Exponential even got three highest accuracies in MovieLens 100K latent factor100, MovieLens 1M latent factor 50 and MovieLens 1M latent factor100, respectively. The accuracy of Dec_NMF-Logistic was observed that are better than traditional NMF in MovieLens 100K, especially two highest accuracies in latent factor 50 and 500. This suggests that there indeed exists periodical regularity in the movie recommendation system, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy. We can observe that non-linear time decay NMFs have higher accuracy in lower latent factor. In MovieLens 100K, we can observe that traditional NMF’s performance is getting better and better with the rise of latent factors. However, we can observe non-linear time decay NMF’s performance is normally higher than linear time decay NMF and traditional NMF. In MovieLens 1M, we can observe that the highest accuracy in different latent factors most are non-linear time decay NMF.
