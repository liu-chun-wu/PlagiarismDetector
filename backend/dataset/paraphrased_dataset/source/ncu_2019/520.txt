After feeding R (mn) which consists of all rating records (rij, tij) into in time decay learning model, we could derive the final output result which could be utilized to predict the user preference and item characteristic more closing to reality, i.e. Dec_NMF preprocesses the Rij(rij, tij) to R’ij(r’ij, tij) simulating the current state. Then feed into NMF which efficiently decompose the latent matrices to get P and Q , preference matrix P (md) and characteristic matrix Q(nd). By multiply P and Q together, we could construct the prediction matrix 𝑅′ ≈𝑃× 𝑄. Given a user-specified number K, for the query about user ui, Dec_NMF will list the top-K largest prediction values of 𝑅′ to do the item recommendation for ui. 4. Performance Evaluation In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed methods comparing with the traditional MF and NMF model. For designing the experiments, we discuss the following research questions: Q1. Can we strengthen the effectiveness of the traditional non-negative matrix factorization architecture by linear and non-linear time decay? Q2. Can we improve the performance of the traditional non-negative matrix factorization by incorporating the impact of preference change? Q3. Can Dec_NMF that leverage linear and nonlinear time decay for each rating such as the time differences, user’s preference and models outperform? Q4. Each recommendation system is trying to solve a problem with different objective using a different dataset and hence. Can Dec_NMF can be applied to usefulness of each error metric? In following sections, we demonstrate the performance of developed Dec_NMF recommendation system.
